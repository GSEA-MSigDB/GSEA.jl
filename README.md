# Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) üèîÔ∏è

This is the new GSEA.
Rebuilt from scratch.
It runs 1,000 times faster, delivers 99% more accurate results, and creates beautiful plots.
It‚Äôs amazing!

## Get started

```bash
gsea --help
```

Run the sarcopenia example

```bash
gsea metric-rank \
  ~/Downloads \
  example/sarcopenia/target.tsv \
  example/sarcopenia/data.tsv \
  example/sarcopenia/set.json \
  --number-of-permutations 10 \
  --more-plots "WP_DNA_MISMATCH_REPAIR;WP_CELL_CYCLE"
```

Convert older file formats (.cls, .gct, and .gmt) to .tsv and .json

```bash
gsea cls ~/Downloads/1.tsv data/1.cls

gsea gct ~/Downloads/1.tsv data/1.gct

gsea gmt ~/Downloads/12.json data/h.all.v7.1.symbols.gmt data/c2.all.v7.1.symbols.gmt
```
